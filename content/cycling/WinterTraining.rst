Toward the end of last year I decided that I couldn't yet face climbing indoors - I get bored of indoor climbing quite quickly and so prefer to wait until nearer Christmas or later to get fit for climbing ready for Spring. Richard in the village had started riding with the Huddersfield Star Wheelers, and so I thought I'd join him while the weather was still OK.
